## About

You have to create an account first and then to login, in order to have full access to the current functionality.

## Important notice 
Please note that the user data entered during sign up and login is stored in the local storage of your device. This means that the data is not secure and can be accessed by anyone with access to your device.

I would like to emphasize that this is only for the purpose of this project, and not for any malicious intent. I have chosen to store the data locally to simplify the process while the main functionality it's pretty much the same by sending a request to a server.
